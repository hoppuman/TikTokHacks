The FitnessGramâ„¢ Pacer Test

is a multistage aerobic capacity test

that progressively gets more difficult

as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test

will begin in 30 seconds.

Line up at the start.

The running speed starts slowly,

but gets faster each minute

after you hear this signal.

[beep]

A single lap should be completed

each time you hear this sound.

[ding]

Remember to run in a straight line,

and run as long as possible.

The second time you fail

to complete a lap before the sound,

your test is over. The test will begin

on the word start. 

On your mark,

get ready,

start.
