Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise?

I thought not.

It's a Sith legend.

It's not a story the Jedi would tell you.

Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith,

So powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence

the midichlorians to create life...

He had such a knowledge of the dark side that

he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.

The dark side of the Force is

a pathway to many abilities

some consider to be unnatural.

He became so powerful...

was losing his power,

the only thing he was afraid of

which eventually, of course, he did.

Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew,

then his apprentice killed him in his sleep.

It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.
